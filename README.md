# QuadB-Tech-Rust-Test

This repository contains solutions for a set of Rust programming problems. Each problem is solved in a separate Rust file.

1. [Check Palindrome](1_check_palindrome.rs): Implement a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
2. [First Occurrence](2_first_occurrence.rs): Given a sorted array of integers, implement a function that returns the index of the first occurrence of a given number.
3. [Shortest Word](3_shortest_word.rs): Given a string of words, implement a function that returns the shortest word in the string.
4. [Check Prime](4_check_prime.rs): Implement a function that checks whether a given number is prime or not.
5. [Median of Array](5_median_of_array.rs): Given a sorted array of integers, implement a function that returns the median of the array.
6. [Longest Common Prefix](6_longest_common_prefix.rs): Implement a function that finds the longest common prefix of a given set of strings.
7. [Kth Smallest](7_kth_smallest.rs): Implement a function that returns the kth smallest element in a given array.
8. [Max Tree Depth](8_max_tree_depth.rs): Given a binary tree, implement a function that returns the maximum depth of the tree.
9. [Reverse String](9_reverse_string.rs): Reverse a string in Rust.
10. [Check Prime in Rust](10_check_prime_rust.rs): Check if a number is prime in Rust.
11. [Merge Sorted Arrays](11_merge_sorted_arrays.rs): Merge two sorted arrays in Rust.
12. [Max Subarray Sum](12_max_subarray_sum.rs): Find the maximum subarray sum in Rust.

## Running the solutions

Each solution can be run by executing the corresponding Rust file. For example, to run the solution for the "Check Palindrome" problem, you would execute the `1_check_palindrome.rs` file.
